Jenkins Ruby Plugins
====================

Getting Started
------

To get started with Jenkins Ruby Plugins, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/version-control.html).

To install on OS/X with Homebrew:

    brew install repo
    brew install gpg

To initialize your local repository using the Jenkins Ruby plugins, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/ccosby/jenkins-ruby-plugins.git -b master

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

Why?
------

This is just a really simple way to get all of the Jenkins Ruby plugins into
a central location. It doesn't offer much other than that.
